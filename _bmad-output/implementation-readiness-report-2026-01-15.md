| FR23 | Instance provisioning | Epic 1, Story 1.0 | ✓ Covered | Manual script documented |

### Coverage Statistics

- **Total PRD FRs:** 23
- **FRs explicitly covered in epics:** 20
- **FRs with partial coverage:** 2 (FR21, FR22 - permission details not explicitly in AC)
- **FRs NOT mentioned in epics:** 1 (FR7 mentioned only implicitly in Story 1.6)
- **Coverage percentage:** 87% explicit, 100% implicit

### ⚠️ Critical Issues & Gaps

#### Issue 1: Permission Matrix Not Explicitly in Acceptance Criteria

**FR21 & FR22:** RBAC matrix exists in PRD (Owner vs Member permissions), but epics don't explicitly call out acceptance criteria for:
- Owner-only actions (configure practices, invite management, view/export events)
- Member-only restrictions (can't manage membership, can't view team config)

**Current state in epics:** Stories show these permissions implicitly, but they're not formalized as AC.

**Recommendation:** Add specific acceptance criteria to Epic 1 or Epic 6 stories that explicitly validate RBAC enforcement.

#### Issue 2: FR18 Interpretation Mismatch

**PRD FR18:** "User (owner) can filter and export events by type and date range"

**Epics Story 5.3:** Shows "System Recommendations" (alternative practices based on Big Five + coverage gaps)

**Epic 6 Story 6.3:** Shows event export (matches PRD)

**Status:** ✓ Technically covered, but Story 5.3 conflates FR18 with recommendations engine (not in PRD scope; noted as post-MVP in PRD)

**Recommendation:** Clarify whether Story 5.3 recommendations are MVP scope or deferred.

#### Issue 3: Post-MVP Features in Epics

**PRD Note:** "Recommendation engine" is explicitly post-MVP (Phase 2)

**Epics Story 5.3:** Includes "System-generated recommendations for alternative practices based on Big Five profile and coverage gaps"

**Status:** ❌ **SCOPE CREEP DETECTED** - This feature is in MVP epics but marked post-MVP in PRD

**Recommendation:** Determine if Story 5.3 (recommendations) should be:
1. **Removed from MVP** (defer to Phase 2), or
2. **Simplified MVP** (show available alternative practices without personality-based ranking), or
3. **Officially promoted to MVP** (update PRD scope)

#### Issue 4: Event Logging Exclusions Clarified

**PRD note:** "Event logs exclude auth/team composition events per research rules"

**Epics Story 6.1:** Correctly excludes auth login, but team composition events handling is unclear

**Current state:** "...except auth login/team composition events per research rules" is documented but not detailed

**Recommendation:** Clarify which team composition events (invite creates? member adds?) are excluded vs. logged.

### Missing NFR Coverage in Acceptance Criteria

**NFR21-NFR22 (Permission enforcement):** Not explicitly tested in any epic's acceptance criteria
- Recommend adding security-focused acceptance criteria to Epic 1, Story 1.0 or dedicated validation story

### Summary

✅ **Coverage:** 20 of 23 FRs explicitly covered; 3 FRs with implicit/partial coverage
⚠️ **Issues:** 
- 2 FRs (FR21-22) lack explicit permission acceptance criteria
- 1 scope creep detected (Story 5.3 recommendations are post-MVP feature)
- 1 NFR coverage gap (permission enforcement not tested)

**Blockers for Implementation:** 
1. ⛔ **Scope Clarification Needed:** Is Story 5.3 (recommendations) MVP or Phase 2?
2. ⛔ **Permission Acceptance Criteria Missing:** FR21-22 need explicit AC validation steps

## Step 4: UX Alignment Assessment

- ✅ Implementation roadmap (Phase 1 core, Phase 2 supporting, Phase 3 enhancements)
- ✅ Copy language tokens for consistent messaging
- ✅ Accessibility guidelines (AA contrast, focus states, keyboard navigation, ARIA patterns)

### ⚠️ UX-to-Architecture Gaps & Warnings

**Issue 1: Story 5.3 (Recommendations) Not in UX Scope**

**From UX Specification:** Story 5.3 claims "System-generated recommendations for alternative practices based on Big Five profile and coverage gaps"

**Status in UX:** UX spec does mention personality context as "gentle sidebar hints (not prescriptive)" and "Personality context gentle sidebar hint (not center stage)", but does NOT detail how recommendations are generated or ranked.

**Status in PRD:** This feature is explicitly marked as post-MVP (Phase 2: "Recommendation engine")

**Status in Architecture:** No details about recommendation algorithm or ranking logic

**Recommendation:** Clarify whether Story 5.3 should:
1. Be removed from MVP and deferred to Phase 2, or
2. Be simplified to "view available alternative practices" (no personality-based ranking), or
3. Include placeholder/mock recommendation logic for MVP

**Issue 2: Personality Integration Scope Unclear**

**From UX:** Multiple references to "personality context" and "Big Five profile" integration
- Story 3.2: "View Big Five profile scores"
- Story 5.3: "System-generated recommendations based on Big Five"
- UX Spec: "Personality context gentle sidebar hints (not prescriptive)"

**Status in Architecture:** No detailed design for how Big Five scores influence UX or recommendation algorithms

**Current Understanding:**
- ✅ Users complete 44-item IPIP-NEO questionnaire (FR11)
- ✅ Users view their Big Five scores (FR12)
- ❓ HOW are Big Five traits used in issue discussions or practice selection?

**Recommendation:** Add explicit architecture design for:
1. Where personality hints are shown (issue detail sidebar, recommendation sidebar, etc.)
2. How personality context is framed to users (supportive, not prescriptive language)
3. Example: "Introversion noted: Consider async communication alternatives"

**Issue 3: Event Logging Visualization Not Detailed in UX**

**From PRD:** FR17 requires "System logs DB-affecting actions (excluding auth/team composition)"

**From UX Spec:** 
- Activity feed shows chronological actions
- "Transparent logging" is a core principle
- "Event log indicators are calm and reassuring, not intrusive"

**Current Gap:** UX spec doesn't detail:
- Where/how event log is shown to users (sidebar, detail view section, separate page?)
- What events are visible to team members vs. facilitators vs. researchers
- How to export events (Story 6.3 mentions CSV/JSON but UX doesn't show export UI)

**Recommendation:** Add UX details for:
1. Activity Feed component (what events are included, display format)
2. Export Panel UI (filter options, format selection, download flow)
3. Event visibility rules (who sees what events in the UI)

### Summary: UX Alignment Status

✅ **OVERALL ALIGNMENT: STRONG (90%+)**

**What's Working:**
- UX specification is comprehensive and well-structured
- Core user journeys (submit issue, resolve conflict, export events) are detailed and implementable
- UX patterns (forms, lists, detail views, modals) are practical and grounded in established precedents
- Design system (Tailwind + custom components) is architecture-aligned
- Accessibility approach (AA contrast, focus states, semantic HTML) is well-defined

**What Needs Clarification:**
1. ⚠️ Recommendations engine (Story 5.3) scope and MVP viability
2. ⚠️ Personality integration scope and UX manifestation
3. ⚠️ Event logging visibility and export flow UI details

**Blockers for Development:**
1. ⛔ **Scope Decision Needed:** Is Story 5.3 (recommendations) MVP or Phase 2?
2. ⛔ **Architecture Clarification Needed:** How are Big Five traits used in the UX?
3. ⛔ **UX Enhancement Needed:** Add explicit design for Activity Feed and Export Panel

- **Impact:** Story 2.1 cannot work without external practice data
- **Recommendation:** Add story for "Practice data import pipeline" (import JSON practices into DB)

**Issue 2: Coverage Calculation Timing**
- Story 2.3-2.4 trigger "coverage % is recalculated"
- **Problem:** No story explicitly defines the coverage calculation algorithm
- **Impact:** Backend implementation needs clear spec for pillar mapping logic
- **Recommendation:** Should be handled in backend services layer; clarify in architecture

**Database/Entity Creation Timing:** ✅ CORRECT

- Story 5.2 "Update Issue Status": Modifies Epic 4 issues
- Story 5.3 "View Recommendations": Suggests alternative practices (but scope unclear)

**Severity:** MODERATE - Forward dependency exists but is documented

**Current Delivery Order:** Epic 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → **5** (CORRECT)

**Epic Independence:** ⚠️ DEPENDENT
- Cannot standalone: Requires Epic 4 issues to exist
- This is appropriate for the sequence but means Epic 5 is not independent
- **Status:** ✅ Acceptable - it's designed as dependent

**Story Quality Assessment:**

| Story | Sizing | Value | Issues |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 5.1: Record Decision | ✅ | ✅ User commits to change | Requires Epic 4 |
| 5.2: Evaluate Outcome | ✅ | ✅ User tracks result | Requires Epic 4 |
| 5.3: View Recommendations | ⚠️ | ⚠️ Scope unclear | SCOPE ISSUE |

**Acceptance Criteria Review:** ✅ STRONG for 5.1-5.2
- BDD format
- Event logging specified
- Status transitions clear

**⚠️ Story 5.3 Scope Issue:**

- Title: "View System Recommendations for Alternative Practices"
- AC claims: "system-generated recommendations for alternative practices based on my Big Five profile and practice pillar coverage gaps"
- **Problem:** This is NOT in PRD scope (marked post-MVP Phase 2)
- **Problem:** No algorithm is defined in Architecture for recommendation ranking
- **Problem:** Epic 3 (Big Five) exists, but connection to recommendations not architected

**Recommendation:** Remove Story 5.3 from MVP or simplify to "View available practices that cover missing pillars" (no personality-based ranking)

**Database/Entity Creation Timing:** ✅ CORRECT
- Story 5.1: Uses decisions table (creates if needed)
- Story 5.2: Updates issue status lifecycle
- **Status:** Appropriate ✅

**Quality Score:** 7/10 ⚠️ GOOD BUT SCOPE ISSUE CRITICAL

---

#### Epic 6: Research Data Integrity & Event Logging

**User Value Focus:** ❌ WEAK (This is a Technical/Research Epic)

- Epic Goal: "Capture immutable, queryable event logs of all DB-affecting actions for research analysis"
- User Outcome: Researchers can analyze personality-practice relationships
- **Issue:** This is a research infrastructure epic, not a user-value epic
- **Severity:** MODERATE
- **Problem:** This violates best practice of user-centric epics
- **Justification:** However, research data integrity is a PRD success criterion, so acceptable as exception

**Epic Independence:** ✅ INDEPENDENT
- Runs in parallel with other epics
- Event logging is infrastructure (runs alongside all operations)
- No forward dependencies
- **Status:** ✅ Acceptable

**Story Quality Assessment:**

| Story | Sizing | Value | Issues |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 6.1: Log All Events | ✅ | ✅ (Research) Captures full audit trail | ✅ |
| 6.2: Ensure Immutability | ✅ | ✅ (Research) Validates data integrity | ✅ |
| 6.3: Export/Filter Events | ✅ | ✅ (Research) Enables analysis | ⚠️ No user-facing export AC |

**Acceptance Criteria Review:** ✅ STRONG
- Event schema clearly specified
- Immutability constraints defined
- Export formats (CSV/JSON) specified
- **Status:** Well-structured ✅

**Issue: Missing User-Facing Export UI**

- Story 6.3 AC focuses on direct DB access for researchers
- **Problem:** PRD FR18 says "User (owner) can filter and export events"
- **Problem:** No story covers the user-facing Export Panel UI
- **Location:** Should be in Epic 4 or 5, not Epic 6
- **Recommendation:** Add story to Epic 4 or 5 for "Export Panel UI" with user-friendly filtering

**Database/Entity Creation Timing:** ✅ CORRECT
- Story 6.1: Creates events table (append-only)
- Story 6.2: Validates immutability constraints
- Story 6.3: Reads from events table
- **Status:** Appropriate ✅

**Quality Score:** 8/10 ⚠️ GOOD BUT MISSING USER-FACING EXPORT

### Dependency Analysis

#### Within-Epic Dependencies (Correct)

```
Epic 1: 1.0 → 1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3 → 1.4 → 1.5 → 1.6 ✅

Epic 2: 2.1 (data load) → 2.2-2.5 (operations) → 2.6-2.7 (coverage) ✅

Epic 3: 3.1 (complete) → 3.2 (display) ✅

Epic 4: 4.1 (submit) → 4.2 (view) → 4.3 (comment) → 4.4 (conflict) ✅

Epic 5: 5.1 → 5.2 → 5.3 (within-epic) ⚠️ (but 5.3 is scope issue)

Epic 6: 6.1 → 6.2 → 6.3 (within-epic) ✅
```

#### Cross-Epic Dependencies (Document Forward/Backward)

```
Epic 1 → Epic 2 (practices used in team setup) ✅ Appropriate

### 🔴 CRITICAL VIOLATIONS

**Issue 1: Story 5.3 - Out of Scope Feature**
- **Story:** Epic 5, Story 5.3 "View System Recommendations"
- **Violation:** Includes post-MVP feature (recommendation engine) in MVP stories
- **Evidence:** PRD explicitly marks as Phase 2; no algorithm defined in architecture
- **Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL
- **Impact:** Cannot implement without scope creep or significant architecture work
- **Resolution:** REMOVE or SCOPE-LIMIT to "View available practices (no ranking)"

**Issue 2: Missing Practice Data Source**
- **Epic:** Epic 2 (Practice Catalog)
- **Problem:** Story 2.1 "Load Catalog" assumes practices exist but no story covers import
- **Evidence:** EPR states "Import pipeline required: JSON → PostgreSQL"
- **Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL
- **Impact:** Development cannot proceed without data seeding/import story
- **Resolution:** ADD story to Epic 2 for "Import practices from JSON"

### 🟠 MAJOR ISSUES

**Issue 3: Epic 2 - Practice Data Dependency Not Explicit**
- **Story:** Epic 2, Story 2.1 + Story 4.1
- **Problem:** Both depend on practice data existing but source is unclear
- **Severity:** 🟠 MAJOR
- **Impact:** Creates hidden blocker between epics
- **Resolution:** Add explicit data import story

**Issue 4: Missing User-Facing Export Panel**
- **Epic:** Epic 6, Story 6.3
- **Problem:** Covers researcher export (direct DB) but not user-facing Export Panel (FR18)
- **Evidence:** PRD FR18: "User (owner) can filter and export events"
- **Severity:** 🟠 MAJOR
- **Impact:** User-facing export requirement missing from stories
- **Resolution:** Add story to Epic 4 or create new story in Epic 6 for "Export Panel UI"

**Issue 5: Epic 5, Story 5.3 - Personality-Recommendation Connection Not Architected**
- **Problem:** Story assumes Big Five influences recommendations but no algorithm is defined
- **Evidence:** Architecture has no recommendation logic; UX has no recommendation UI details
- **Severity:** 🟠 MAJOR
- **Impact:** Story cannot be implemented without additional architecture work
- **Resolution:** Either remove Story 5.3 or add architecture for recommendation algorithm

### 🟡 MINOR CONCERNS

**Issue 6: Epic 6 - Technical Epic Justification**
- **Epic Goal:** "Research data integrity"
- **Concern:** This is infrastructure, not user-centric (violates best practice)
- **Justification:** Valid because research data integrity is PRD success criterion
- **Severity:** 🟡 MINOR
- **Resolution:** Document exception; this is acceptable given research nature

**Issue 7: Epic 5 - Dependent Epic Sequence**
- **Concern:** Epic 5 cannot function without Epic 4
- **Status:** This is by design (Epic 4 → Epic 5 sequence)
- **Severity:** 🟡 MINOR
- **Resolution:** Document as dependent epic; sequence is correct

### Quality Assessment Summary

**Overall Quality Score:** 7.5/10 ⚠️ GOOD BUT WITH CRITICAL GAPS

**Strengths:**
- ✅ All epics deliver user value (except Epic 6, justified as research requirement)
- ✅ Story sizing is appropriate (2-8 stories per epic)
- ✅ Acceptance criteria are well-structured (BDD format, comprehensive)
- ✅ Within-epic dependencies are logical and correct
- ✅ Stories are independently completable (mostly)

**Critical Gaps Blocking Development:**
1. ❌ Story 5.3 (Recommendations) is out-of-scope feature → MUST REMOVE OR SCOPE-LIMIT
2. ❌ Missing practice data import story → MUST ADD to Epic 2
3. ❌ Missing user-facing export UI story → MUST ADD to Epic 4 or 6
4. ❌ No recommendation algorithm architecture → MUST REMOVE Story 5.3 or add architecture

**Blockers for Implementation:**
- 🛑 **Remove Story 5.3** or clarify if it's MVP vs Phase 2
- 🛑 **Add Practice Import Story** to Epic 2
- 🛑 **Add Export Panel UI Story** to Epic 4 or 6
- 🛑 **Clarify Recommendations Architecture** before proceeding with Story 5.3

# FINAL IMPLEMENTATION READINESS ASSESSMENT

## Overall Readiness Status

### 🟠 **CONDITIONAL READINESS** 

**Status:** Project is ready to proceed with **CRITICAL CONDITIONS** that must be addressed before sprint planning.

**Summary:** 
- ✅ PRD is comprehensive and well-structured (23 FRs, 9 NFRs)
- ✅ Architecture is detailed and technically sound
- ✅ UX specification is excellent and implementation-ready
- ✅ Epics deliver user value and follow best practices
- ⚠️ **BUT:** 4 critical gaps must be resolved before development starts

---

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action

### 🔴 CRITICAL BLOCKER #1: Story 5.3 (Recommendations) - Out of Scope

**Issue:** Epic 5, Story 5.3 includes recommendation engine, which PRD explicitly marks as post-MVP (Phase 2)

**Evidence:**
- PRD states: "Recommendation engine" is listed under "Growth Features (Post-MVP)"
- Architecture: No recommendation algorithm design or ranking logic defined
- UX Spec: "Personality context gentle sidebar hints (not prescriptive)" but no recommendation UI design

**Impact:** 
- Attempting to implement Story 5.3 as-is will cause scope creep
- Cannot deliver in 3-week MVP timeline without de-scoping other critical features
- No algorithm defined = implementation ambiguity

**REQUIRED DECISION: Choose One**
1. **REMOVE Story 5.3** from MVP completely, or
2. **SIMPLIFY Story 5.3** to "View available practices that cover missing pillars" (no personality-based ranking), or
3. **ADD ARCHITECTURE** for recommendation algorithm and update Story 5.3 AC

**Recommendation:** **REMOVE Story 5.3** - defer to Phase 2 where personality correlation analysis is properly scoped

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL BLOCKER #2: Missing Practice Data Import Story

**Issue:** Epic 2 assumes practice catalog data exists but no story covers import/seeding

**Evidence:**
- PRD states: "Practice catalog + search/filter" (FR8-10)
- Architecture notes: "Import pipeline required: JSON → PostgreSQL with validation"
- Story 2.1 AC: "When the page loads, I see a list of all practices"
  - **Question:** Where do practices come from?

**Impact:**
- Story 2.1 (Load Catalog) cannot be completed without practice data
- Development team will discover this when starting Sprint 1
- Creates hidden blocker between design and implementation

**REQUIRED ACTION:**
- **ADD Story 2.X to Epic 2:** "Import Practice Data from JSON"
  - Load practices JSON from reference data
  - Validate schema and pillar mappings
  - Seed PostgreSQL practices table
  - Verify all 19 pillars and 5 categories are loaded

**Recommendation:** Add this story as **Story 2.0** (first story in Epic 2), completing before Story 2.1

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL BLOCKER #3: Missing User-Facing Export Panel UI Story

**Issue:** PRD FR18 requires "User (owner) can filter and export events" but no story covers UI

**Evidence:**
- PRD FR18: "User (owner) can filter and export events by type and date range"
- Epic 6, Story 6.3: Covers researcher direct-DB export only
- Story 6.3 AC: "Given I'm an admin/researcher with database access"
  - This is backend/researcher, NOT user-facing

**Impact:**
- User-facing export requirement is not implemented in any story
- Owner users cannot fulfill FR18 requirement via UI
- Event export is researcher-only (not user-facing)

**REQUIRED ACTION:**
- **ADD Story to Epic 4 or Epic 6:** "Export Events Panel with User-Friendly Filtering"
  - Filter events by: event type, date range, team (if multi-tenant)
  - Select export format: CSV or JSON
  - Download file with complete event history
  - Clear feedback: "Export contains X events, Y bytes"

**Recommendation:** Add to **Epic 4** (after Story 4.4) or **Epic 6** (before Story 6.3)

---

### 🟠 MAJOR ISSUE #4: Personality-Recommendation Architecture Gap

**Issue:** Story 5.3 assumes Big Five traits drive recommendations but no algorithm exists

**Evidence:**
- Story 5.3 AC: "system recommends: 'Asynchronous Status Updates' (matches your Introversion trait)"
- Architecture: Zero details on recommendation ranking, filtering, or Big Five correlation
- UX Spec: No UI design for recommendation presentation or algorithm
- PRD: Research validity noted but Phase 2

**Impact:**
- If keeping Story 5.3, implementation team lacks algorithm spec
- Recommendation ranking is ambiguous: personality-based? coverage-based? hybrid?
- Cannot implement without additional architecture work

**REQUIRED DECISION:**
1. If **REMOVING Story 5.3:** Issue resolved ✅
2. If **KEEPING Story 5.3:** **ADD Architecture Design** for:
   - Recommendation scoring algorithm
   - Integration with Big Five profiles
   - Ranking strategy
   - Example recommendations and reasoning

**Recommendation:** **REMOVE Story 5.3** and defer recommendation engine to Phase 2
