# Practice Tags

## 1. Interaction & Communication Style

These tags help users identify how they are expected to communicate.

### Verbal-Heavy

**Description:** Success relies heavily on speaking up, debating, or verbalizing thoughts in real-time.

**Examples:** Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Three Amigos.

**Rationale:** Critical for introverts or those with social anxiety who find "fighting for airtime" in a group discussion draining.

### Visual / Tactile

**Description:** Uses physical or digital boards, cards, or diagrams to communicate rather than just conversation.

**Examples:** Kanban Board, Story Mapping, Planning Poker, Example Mapping.

**Rationale:** Helpful for visual thinkers and those who struggle with auditory processing or abstract verbal explanations.

### Written / Asynchronous-Ready

**Description:** Can be accomplished effectively through writing or offline contribution without immediate real-time presence.

**Examples:** Definition of Done (Drafting), Writing User Stories, A3 Report.

**Rationale:** Preferred by people who need processing time to formulate their thoughts or those working across time zones.

## 2. Social Density & Energy

These tags identify the "social cost" of the practice.

### Whole Crowd

**Description:** Requires the presence and attention of the entire team (and sometimes stakeholders).

**Examples:** Sprint Planning, Lean Coffee, Overall Retrospective.

**Rationale:** High energy drain for introverts; potential for sensory overload for neurodivergent individuals.

### Small Group / Pair

**Description:** Done in intimate groups of 2-3 people.

**Examples:** Pair Programming, Three Amigos, Peer Review.

**Rationale:** Often easier for those who find large groups intimidating but still want collaboration.

### Solo-Capable

**Description:** Can be performed individually, even if the result is shared later.

**Examples:** TDD (Red/Green steps), Preparing an A3 Report, Updating the Kanban Board.

**Rationale:** Crucial for recharging social batteries.

## 3. Structure & Cognitive Load

These tags filter based on how the session is organized and how much mental improvisation is required.

### Gamified

**Description:** Uses distinct rules, turns, voting mechanisms, or physical props.

**Examples:** Planning Poker, Lean Coffee, Dot Voting.

**Rationale:** Highly effective for ADHD or Autism as the explicit rules and "game" mechanics reduce social ambiguity and keep engagement high.

### Structured / Facilitated

**Description:** Has a clear agenda, a facilitator, and specific steps (not a free-for-all).

**Examples:** Sprint Retrospective, Example Mapping, Design Sprint.

**Rationale:** Reduces anxiety about "what happens next" or "what is expected of me."

### Spontaneous / Improv

**Description:** Requires thinking on your feet, answering unexpected questions, or brainstorming from scratch.

**Examples:** Swarming, Mob Programming, Daily Scrum (if unstructured).

**Rationale:** Potentially stressful for those who need preparation time or struggle with performance anxiety.

### Time-Boxed

**Description:** Has a strict, short duration (often <15 mins or rigid intervals).

**Examples:** Daily Scrum, Lean Coffee, Pomodoro.

**Rationale:** Helps those with ADHD maintain focus and prevents meetings from dragging on, which helps manage energy levels.

## 4. Emotional & Conflict Exposure

These tags identify practices that might trigger emotional responses or rejection sensitivity.

### High Exposure

**Description:** The individual is "on stage," demonstrating work or admitting failure/blockers publicly.

**Examples:** Sprint Review (Demoing), Daily Scrum (admitting being stuck).

**Rationale:** Triggering for those with imposter syndrome or high social anxiety.

### Consensus-Driven

**Description:** The activity cannot end until everyone agrees (or compromises).

**Examples:** Planning Poker, Definition of Done, Team Canvas.

**Rationale:** Can be draining for those who are conflict-averse or find negotiation exhausting.

### Critical / Introspective

**Description:** Involves analyzing what went wrong, identifying faults, or critiquing work.

**Examples:** Sprint Retrospective, 5 Whys, Graveyard of Gloom.

**Rationale:** Difficult for those with Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) or those who take criticism personally.
